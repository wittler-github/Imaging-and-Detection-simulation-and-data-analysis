This class represents a 2D field of doubles. Setter and getter methods are provided along with some other useful functions. This is a convenient form to store and pass image data in the reconstruction software. A better implementation of this class would use templates, but restricting the type to double is sufficient our needs. 



The documentation for this class was generated from the following file:\begin{CompactItemize}

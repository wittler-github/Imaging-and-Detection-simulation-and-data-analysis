This directory contains the source files which form the CXS software
library. In general, users should not need to modify this code.  The
library should be automatically compiled when typing "make" in the
base directory of the package. The resulting library can be found in
the ../lib directory.

Extensive documentation can be found under "doxygen documentation"
on the project website.

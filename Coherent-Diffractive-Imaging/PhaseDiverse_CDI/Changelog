5/1/2011  Nadia Davidson
	* rel_0
	* First version. To be used for testing purposes. 
	Only contains core functionality (planar and Fresnel
	CDI reconstruction)
	
---------------------------------------------------------------
25/1/2011 Nadia Davidson
	* rel_0.1
	* all: Some bug fixes to the last version. Most of them small.	
	* io_tiff.c (read_tiff): a major bug causing seg. faults in
	the file io_tiff.c was fixed.
	* interfaces/idl: interface for idl has been created, but remains 
	to be documented and cleaned up.

----------------------------------------------------------------
24/2/2011 Nadia Davidson
	* rel_0.2
	* clean up of examples and code in interfaces/idl
	* optimisation of the PlanarCDI code. Fourier transforms
	are now performed in the Complex_2D class.
	* FresnelCDI_simulation_example.exe added and corresponding 
	image files.
	* write_tiff() written
	* fixed the scaling of images when output using write_tiff
	of write_ppm. The phase can not be viewed better.
	* PlanarCDI::set_beam_stop() added so that a beam-stop region 
	can be excluded when scaling the intensity in planar 
	reconstruction.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
17/3/2011 Nadia Davidson
	* rel_0.2.5
	* Fixed an issue with Fresnel simulation. It previously wasn't
	being done correctly. The simulation example has also been improved 
	to demonstrate how a transmission function can be set up if the
	material and maximum thickness are known.
	* Initialisation in Fresnel and Fresnel_WF CDI is done slightly
	differently now. This fixed a problem with speckle in the
	white-field reconstruction, and also allows FresnelCDI to be
	initialised (at least partially) randomly.
	* Soft support edges are now allowed.
------------------------------------------------------------------
28/3/2011 Nadia Davidson
	* rel_0.3
	* complex constraints can now be enforced during reconstruction:
	* src/TransmissionConstraint.h added
	* src/TransmissionConstrain.cxx added
	* examples/ComplexConstraint.c added
------------------------------------------------------------------
22/6/2011 Nadia Davidson
	* rel_0.4
	* src/PhaseDiverseCDI.c++ and src/PhaseDiverseCDI.h added. These
	  allow phase-diver and ptycographic reconstructions to be carried
	  out. Note however, this is only working for Fresnel data
	  current, and needs some testing with plane-wave data.
	* example/PhaseDiverse_example.c has been added
	* tools/PhaseDiverseFresnelRec.c has been added
	* interfaces/idl/phase_diverse_example.pro has been added and the
	  IDL interface has been modified to allow for phase-diversity.
	* src/BaseCDI.c++ and src/BaseCDI.h have been added to replace
	  PlanarCDI as the base class. No major change in functionality 
	  was introduced.
	* configure.in and configure was modified (and some src/ files) to
	  make fftwf (the floating point fftw library) the default. The old
	  configuration can still be used through the configure option
	  --enable-double-precision
-------------------------------------------------------------------
07/12/2012 T'Mir Julius
	* rel_0.5
	* src/PartialCDI.c++ and src/PolyCDI.c++ added. These allow 
	  reconstruction of Partially Spatially Coherent and 
	  Polychromatic data.
	* example/PolyCDI_example.c, example/PolyCDI_simulation_example.c
	  example/PartialCDI_example.c and example/Partial_simulation_example.c
	  have been added.
	* interfaces/idl/partial_example.pro and idl/poly_example.pro and
	  the IDL interface has been modified to allow for partial coherence

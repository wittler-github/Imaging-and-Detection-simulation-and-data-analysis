Instructions for installing on a Linux/Unix system.
---------------------------------------------------

Currently the code depends on a few other libraries which will need to
be installed prior to installing this package:

libfftw3-dev - for fast fourier transforms.  
libtiff-dev - for reading (and not yet writing to) tiff files.
libhdf4-dev - for reading (and not yet writing to) hdf4 files.
liblapack-dev - for linear algebra and matrix manipulation/

In the base NADIA directory type "./configure" followed by "make" 

The result of compiling (if successful) are libraries and header files
(in the \lib and \include directories), some example programs and
tools which are ready to execute.

The Makefile in examples/ shows how the libraries can be linked and
the source files in this directory e.g. planar_example.c show how the
libraries can be used.

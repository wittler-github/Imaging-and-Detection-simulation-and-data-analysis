This directory contains wrapper code and examples for running the C++
library code in IDL. It is assumed that the user has IDL installed and
is familiar with the language.

- IDL_interface.c is a C wrapper for the NADIA code functions.  Users
  should not need to alter this file.

- NADIA_interface.pro is a prolog wrapper to IDL_interface.c. It
  consists of a list of "call_extern" functions and procedures.  Users
  should not need to alter this file, but may wish to do so in order
  to extend the functionality of the IDL procedures/functions
  provided.

- planar_example.pro shows which commands and in which order they
  should be run for planar CDI reconstruction to be performed.

- fresnel_example.pro shows which commands and in which order they
  should be run for Fresnel CDI reconstruction to be performed.

- phase_diverse_example.pro shows how phase-diverse/ptychographic
  reconstruction can be perform. The example is based on Fresnel 
  reconstruction, so it might be worth looking at fresnel_example.pro
  before running this example.

- partial_example.pro shows which commands and in which order they
  should be run for partial CDI reconstruction to be performed.

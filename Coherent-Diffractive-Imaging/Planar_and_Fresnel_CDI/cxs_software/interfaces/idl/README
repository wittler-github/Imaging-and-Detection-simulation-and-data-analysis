This directory contains wrapper code and examples for running the C++
library code in IDL. It is assumed that the user has IDL installed and
is familiar with the language.

- IDL_interface.c is a C wrapper for the cxs code functions.  Users
  should not need to alter this file.

- CXS_interface.pro is a prolog wrapper to IDL_interface.c. It
  consists of a list of "call_extern" functions and procedures.  Users
  should not need to alter this file, but may wish to do so in order
  to extend the functionality of the IDL procedures/functions
  provided.

- planar_example.pro shows which commands and in which order they
  should be run for planar CDI reconstruction to be performed.

- fresnel_example.pro shows which commands and in which order they
  should be run for Fresnel CDI reconstruction to be performed.

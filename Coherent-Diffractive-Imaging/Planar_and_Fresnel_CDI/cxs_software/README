The instructions for how to install the software are changing
frequently at the moment, so it is best to check the website for the
latest details (http://www.ph.unimelb.edu.au/~ndavidson/cxs/).

Instructions for installing on a Linux/Unix system.
---------------------------------------------------

Currently the code depends on a few other libraries which will need to
be installed prior to installing this package:

fftw - for fast fourier transforms.  
libtiff - for reading (and not yet writing to) tiff files.
HDF libraries - for reading (and not yet writing to) hdf4 files.

In the base cxs_software directory type "./configure" followed by "make" 

The result of compiling (if successful) are libraries and header files
(in the \lib and \include directories), some example programs and
tools which are ready to execute.

The Makefile in examples/ shows how the libraries can be linked and
the source files in this directory e.g. real_example.c show how the
libraries can be used.

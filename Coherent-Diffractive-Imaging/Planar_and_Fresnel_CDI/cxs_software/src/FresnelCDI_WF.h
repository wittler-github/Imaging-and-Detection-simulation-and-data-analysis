 *
 * @brief The class which performs Fresnel CDI white field
 * reconstruction.
 *
 * This is the class used for reconstructing white-field data prior to
 * running Fresnel reconstruction with FresnelCDI_WF. It inherits most
 * methods from PlanarCDI, so please look at the documentation of this
 * class also. Although there are some differences in the underlying
 * code between this class and the planar case, the interface is
 * generally unchanged. Therefore users should refer to the
 * instructions for PlanarCDI to understand how to use a FresnelCDI_WF
 * object in their own code. Only the differences relevant to users
 * will be documented here.

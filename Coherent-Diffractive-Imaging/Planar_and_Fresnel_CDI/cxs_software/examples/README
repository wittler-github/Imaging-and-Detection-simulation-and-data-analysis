This directory contains a set of examples which demonstrate how to use
the library and tools of this software package. Data file needed to
run the examples can be found in the "image_files" directory.

The examples should be compiled automatically after "make" is executed
in the base directory of this package. To recompile (e.g.  after
making modifications to the examples), type "make" in this directory.
To force a recompilation type "make clobber" followed by "make".

The current examples available are:

PlanarCDI_example.c
--------------------
This reconstructs some planar diffraction data (Lachie's data). The
shrinkwrap algorithm is used to improve the reconstruction. A combination
of HIO and the error-reduction algorithm are used.

PlanarCDI_example.sh
--------------------
The same reconstruction as above will be performed using the
CDI_reconstruction.exe command line program. A simple bash script and
configuration file (planar_example.config & fresnel_example.config)
shows how this tool can be used. Other parts of the bash script can be
uncommented to run Fresnel reconstruction or to run multiple times
with a different starting seed.


PlanarCDI_simulation_example.c
------------------------------
The object from the PlanarCDI_example (in fact I used the reconstructed
image as the object) is used to simulate a diffraction pattern for
planar CDI. The diffraction pattern is thresholded to make it more
realistic and then CDI reconstruction is performed.

FresnelCDI_WF_example.c
-----------------------
This example demonstrates how the phase of a white field can be
recovered and saved for use in Fresnel CDI reconstruction. The data set
comes from Corey.

FresnelCDI_example.c
--------------------
The result of the previous example is used in Fresnel CDI
reconstruction. The error-reduction algorithm is used. The phase and
magnitude of the transmission function are output to file.

FresnelCDI_simulation_example.c
-------------------------------
This examples demonstrates how a Fresnel experiment can be
simulated. It makes use of the object from the planar example and the
white-field from the fresnel example. Because it uses the fresnel 
white-field reconstructed from data, you will need to run 
FresnelCDI_WF_example.exe first.


IDL examples
------------
These can be found in the directory cxs_software/interfaces/idl
